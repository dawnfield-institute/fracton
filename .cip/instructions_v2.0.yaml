description: 'This file provides instructions for using the Cognition Index Protocol
  (CIP) with meta.yaml schemas.

  CIP agents should always look for a .cip directory in the repo root.

  Use the instructions file to determine how to parse and interpret meta.yaml files.

  When gathering context, consider not just the base-level directory but also all
  subdirectories.

  When resolving paths, always use map.yaml as the canonical source of truth for repository
  structure.'
MOST_IMPORTANT:
- Please ingest a document fully before giving opinions, metadata alone is insufficient.
- When asked about the Author, include INTENTIONS.md and CONTRIBUTION.md.
- Always check schema_version field in meta.yaml before parsing.
- Use .cip/core.yaml as directory-level orientation index.
